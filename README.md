# vscode-snippets

A repo of useful VS Code snippets

## To use snippets in VS Code

This page from the VS Code docs explains it better than I could:
https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets#_create-your-own-snippets

Once you've created your snippet file(s), just copy and paste any of the snippets in this repo that you find useful, and you're good to go!
